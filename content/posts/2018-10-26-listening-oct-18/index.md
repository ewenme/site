## $hit and $hine, Very High EP _(Diagonal)_

I bought this one on a solo trip to
[Rough Trade East](https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/stores#rough-trade-east),
killing time before linking some friends at Genesis on Commercial St (PS I liked
the staff outfits way more than the food there). Looks like your regulation
hand-stamped white label from afar, but up close the type is no easier to read.
I didn't know who made it 'til I got home and read up. Truly felt like the "very
high" EP.

Not gonna lie, they had me with the
[Steely Dan flip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzrDs_Vaho4), let alone the
[Ri-Ri sample](https://youtu.be/B3eAMGXFw1o). I played the A-side at the 'wrong'
speed in the shop, but it worked on me - turned a 90-ish bpm R&B chugger into a
springy funk jam and lent the vox that half-chipmunk effect (which I'm a sucker
for). Some more voices (one amongst these is from [Road
Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Wars_(TV_series), apparently?!) drift
in and out of focus and freakishness throughout, with layers of distortion
adding to the trip. Fits right at home on Diagonal.

## Peverelist, IDLE050 _(Idle Hands)_

Gripped on the same trip as the one above. I did feel a bit voyeuristic about
this ode to [Idle Hands](https://idlehandsbristol.com/), a Bristol record shop
I'm still yet to actually step inside. On the back of the record is a short
story about how the shop came to be, penned by Joe Cowton AKA Kowton. Anyone
who's followed him on twitter will immediately recognize the familiar humorous
droll, but there's genuine warmth and inspiration here as he recounts the
desperate times (feat. daily "stale cheese sandwiches") of Rooted Records (RIP)
and brighter days feat. Sam Binga's fervorous painting skills (his bright green
choice of 2011 has since been retired, unfortunately). He actually mentions
punters at oversea gigs chatting glowingly about the shop having never visited,
which helped me feel less creepy.

In keeping with the landmark catalogue number, Pev is on full-on party vibes on
the A-side, 'Left Hand'. Ravey piano stabs and percussive drive reminiscent of
[Skull Disco](https://www.discogs.com/label/45565-Skull-Disco) era Shackleton
are in full effect. This bounce reminds me a lot of
[Dance Until The Police Come](https://www.discogs.com/Peverelist-Dance-Til-The-Police-Come/release/2801759),
but the hums of paranoia and screwfaces are washed away and replaced with
ear-to-ear smiles. On the flip, Pev just goes and 'Pevs' it - watertight drums
drenched in subs. Sparse, distant, submerged. One to bump very loud and in the
dark.

## Lil Mofo, RA.645 _(Resident Advisor)_

I first listened to this mix on my Monday morning commute. Maybe the time in my
week which is hardest to avoid "going through the motions". Something she said
in an accompanying Q&A perfectly describes the all-encompassing jolt it gave me.

> "What I can do is just do what I can do (DJ) to mix up the people to feel
> better in this super-stressed society."

This utilitarian and giving ethos is too often missing from many moments spent
in a metropolis like London. Even on it's dancefloors. At it's core, this
attitude is what I'm really trying to find (unconsciously or not) in DJs, but it
goes a bit beyond that. If the DJ isn't looking out for you, then who is...

Mofo shimmys effortlessly through ambient, jungle, trance, garage and techno
beat structures (amongst others), and juggles this with a deep sensitivity to
mood all the way to
[Joy's closer](https://www.discogs.com/composition/123e4008-660f-4d06-a37c-2793e7073731-Fuerza).
I've been coming back to this one when I could do with tuning in to the world
(and back out). Once you're done checking this out you should
[go peep ALL the soundclouds](https://soundcloud.com/search?q=LIL%20MOFO%20BUSINESS)!

## Joy O, 81b _(Hinge Finger)_

Courtesy of
[Honest Jons dance wall](https://honestjons.com/shop/category/Dance/New_fresh_back_in).
Digi is up on the
[Toss Portal bandcamp](https://tossportal.bandcamp.com/album/81b), too.

I think Joy is one of the few real constants in my dance music listening habits,
at least since I started going to clubs. Lots of my happiest times in clubs have
been punctuated by those killer records. If I'm being honest (and corny),
hearing [_Hyph Mngo_](https://www.discogs.com/hyph-mngo/release/1966779) come
through the store speakers while working at All Saints was a musical
re-awakening for me (having been distracted by paint-by-numbers, Hospital
Records template DnB uni raves for a bit), and made me excited about London's
sounds again. Nostalgia-bathing is nice, but more importantly the tunes still
bang.

Those classic Joy O signifiers are dotted over _81b_, but sit next to fresh and
varied soundscapes. There's the warm patter of a record shop punter passing on a
2-step record at the start of _COYP_ (come on you Palace!), echoing the intro
styles of _Fuerza_ (featured on Lil Mofo's mix, incidentally) and the
[TTT mix](https://soundcloud.com/the-trilogy-tapes/joy-orbison-x-ttt-x-hinge),
but wrapped in a hypnotizing chug that builds on the recent
[_CO/R_](https://www.discogs.com/COR-Gudrun/release/8800843) and
[_Toss Portal_](https://www.discogs.com/Joy-Orbison-Toss-Portal/release/9838722)
records. _Seed_ delivers the customary Dancefloor Rescue Track for DJs
everywhere, wavy drum patterns sprinkled with a dark and infectious chopped up
vocal, while _TENNOV6TEEN_ does a sick Tangerine Dreams/John Carpenter
impression (one for the _Stranger Things_ heads) via a beatless sizzling synth.

I actually listened to it all the way through for the first time on a Sunday,
the morning after a late mixing session with friends. The depth and detail of
the tracks meant it sounded vibrant, even refreshing, after a barrage of club
sounds the night before. Would recommend this setting to get your ears around
it.

## SOPHIE, live _(Fabric, 23.10.18)_

This was so much fun. Room One @ [Fabric](https://www.fabriclondon.com/) is a
great place to be rattled around by artists that know how to bathe it in low
frequencies. I remember seeing Kano in full flow at a
[Butterz](http://butterz.co.uk/) night in the same room a few years back, and I
didn't think I'd see someone have the place in the palm of their hand like that
again.

I'm still smiling thinking about
[this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uqTbCODPEk) having everyone lose
their shit while SOPHIE calmly dragged on her cig amid the chaos. Go see her in
your town or someone elses, it's a beautiful reminder of what unified joy and
overdosing on bassweight feels like.
