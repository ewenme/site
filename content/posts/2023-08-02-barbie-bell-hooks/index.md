I read my first bell hooks book, _The Will to Change: Men, Masculinity, and
Love_, earlier this year. It's verging on embarrassing to admit as a man
approaching middle age, but my internal feminist logic before this study was
back-of-a-fag-packet, hr-diversity-and-inclusion-seminar level stuff. I enjoyed
the
[MORE üëè WOMEN üëè DRONE PILOTS üëè meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1353985-hire-more-women-guards)
and nodded along when podcasts would deliver "respect women" platitudes when
detailing Megan Thee Stallion being shot. On occasion, I may have felt comforted
by sincerely thinking to myself: _I'm an ally._

I'm def in dicey "reads bell hooks once" territory here but as a man sat
squarely in the middle of the millennial age bracket, reading her pen is to
learn:

- the extent to which your own spiritual suffering is promised under patriarchy
- how matriarchal thinking has it's own toxic domination logic
- the importance of solidarity between cisgender men and women to dismantle
  patriarchal forms
- that spiritual healing and nurturing of men is possible, and possible, within
  a radical feminist vision

My first real, short-lived job out of university was a recruitment consultant in
Nottingham on 16k a year (and if you're thinking I got juicy commissions,
unfortunately I was shit at all elements of this profession). I worked in a very
small (~10 ppl) office that was almost exclusively women.

I want to process my thoughts on _Barbie_ while they're hot.
