I thought _Barbie_ (2023) was a solid film. Powerful tonal shifts, a mostly
banging soundtrack and emotional heft in the right places. There's the whole
franchise/sequel dark age critique that has been done to death, although
[Blindboy found an angle](https://play.acast.com/s/blindboy/barbie-and-mattel-as-millennial-pavlovian-conditioning)
wondering when millennials will finally be marketed to as middle-age instead of
"young people" that I lapped up. Here, I just want to do a little vent about the
ending and why it felt pessimistic to me.

Full disclosure: I read my first bell hooks book, _The Will to Change: Men,
Masculinity, and Love_, earlier this year. It's maybe embarrassing to admit as a
man approaching middle age, but my internal feminist logic before this was
back-of-a-fag-packet, hr-diversity-and-inclusion-seminar level stuff. I enjoyed
the
[MORE üëè WOMEN üëè DRONE PILOTS üëè meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1353985-hire-more-women-guards)
and nodded along when podcasts would deliver "respect women" platitudes, perhaps
while detailing Megan Thee Stallion being shot. On occasion, I may have even
comforted myself by sincerely thinking "I'm an ally" or, another cringe-fest,
"I'm Doing The Work".

I'm likely in dicey "reads bell hooks once" slash "33 YO man REACTS to bell
hooks for the first time!" territory here but as a Geezer reading this book I
learnt:

- the extent to which male spiritual suffering is guaranteed under patriarchy
- without an anti-patriarchal mindset, feminism is prone to reproduce a logic of
  domination
- how solidarity between men and women, rooted in love, is necessary to
  dismantle patriarchal forms
- that spiritual healing and nurturing of men is possible, and necessary, within
  a radical feminist vision for change

<!-- I have to credit [Jaded Forum](https://youtu.be/CKmf5_EOdck) with first putting me
on, really, to how the patriarchy hurts men. Reading hooks' pen made me count,
and sit with, all of these ways. I used to frame my upbringing in a single-parent,
all-female household in a way that surely granted me immunity from falling into anti-feminist actions. My mum was well into _all men are bastards_ (AMAB) discourse but made sure to add an "except you, Ewen" disclaimer. In reality, it's impossible to be "raised by women" - I had a mostly-present dad and, for long stretches, another man lived in my house with me. I knew other kids who had their own dads, I was part of exclusively male friendship groups that
spanned different ages and muscle mass. I got given the "man of the house" talk. These were the people who schooled me on what "manhood" was and it was debilitating. --->

Here's a related anecdote. My first stable, short-lived job out of university
was a recruitment consultant in Nottingham on 16k a year (and if you're thinking
I got juicy commissions instead, I was unbelievably shit at this profession). I
worked in a very small (~10 ppl) office that was almost exclusively women. Very
progressive and cool, I thought! As it turns out, the standard tools of
domination were routinely wielded over my precarious, pathetic employment
contract with absolutely no bother. I was targeted on the number of cold calls I
was making every day, given the dreaded personal development plan (AKA we want
to sack you, nice and legally) and even taught how to skim money off the top of
our contractors pay packets via umbrella companies. The "floor" had an
ultra-competitive, money-obsessed air that frequently bubbled over into
confrontation and hostility. It turned out this matriarchy didn't create a
healthy workplace by osmosis, it was giving disciplinaries and trauma. To make
it abundantly clear - on a personal level, I had time for almost everyone in the
building. I rate recruitment as a realistic avenue for working class, often
non-graduates to make a decent living (eventually). My lasting observation is
that a traditionally hierarchical, toxic, macho culture reasserted it's
exploitative practices via women who had learnt well from the patriarchs that
came before them. As hooks says:

> More than ever before in our nation's history, females are encouraged to
> assume the patriarchal mask and bury their emotional selves as deeply as their
> male counterparts do. Females embrace this paradigm because they feel it is
> better to be a dominator than to be dominated. However, this is a perverse
> vision of gender equality that offers women equal access to the house of the
> dead. In that house there will be no love.

**Oi!!! Barbie spoiler warning ahead**

Much of _Barbie_ is set in a fictional, sugary sweet kingdom called "Barbie
land". One of the film's central tensions is how the "Kens" are made to occupy
the role of the dominated under a matriarchy and experience oppression from
various social and decision-making spheres. A tag-line used all over the film's
marketing is "Barbie is Everything. Ken is Everything Else". As the film
progresses, it elegantly tees up an opportunity for the Kens to rebrand the
kingdom as Ken Land and establish an overt, trashy patriarchy. The film
concludes with the full restoration of Barbieland to it's default matriarchal
society, as seen in the films opening scenes.
