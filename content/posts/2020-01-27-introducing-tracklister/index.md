I've spent a bit of time this month getting into [React](https://reactjs.org/),
2019's most beloved web framework (according to
[Stack Overflow's latest dev survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-web-frameworks)).
Rather than dive in blind, I decided to start off by porting/extending
[something I made earlier](https://github.com/ewenme/traklister) with Shiny (R's
bff web framework). The result?

Introducing [tracklister](https://tracklister.club/), a simple web app made to
help users of
[Native Instruments' Traktor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traktor) or
[Pioneer's Rekordbox](https://rekordbox.com/en/) parse playlist and history
files. As a DJ using these programs, I found myself frustrated that getting
minimal (i.e. tracks, artists only) tracklists in plain-tect formats for sharing
somewhere like [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/) was surprisingly difficult.
_tracklister_ attempts to restore the balance!

It's already bigged up in the official React docs, but ICYMI - if you're looking
to get into React yourself, no better place to go than
[Tania Rascia's intro](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/).
