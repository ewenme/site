[Buy Music Club](https://buymusic.club/) was launched last week by
[Avalon Emerson](http://avalonemerson.com/) and a few other contributors (scroll
down to the bottom of the homepage for the full _Credits_ roll call). You can
share records or tracks with links to play and buy them from
[Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/), one of the more equitable platforms for indie
artists and labels to get paid. This project is an ingeniously simple way to
broadcast great tunes and to encourage support for the artist directly.

I made a playlist of stuff that stuck with me this year, both the rough and the
smooth. Check it out and cop the things u like. Love and thanks go out to all
the artists.
