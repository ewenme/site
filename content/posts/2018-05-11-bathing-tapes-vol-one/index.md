Last month I recorded a studio mix at home on the 1210s, the first volume of an
occasional series for me to share sounds I'm bumping heavy. I'm calling it
_bathing tapes_ (don't @ me, [Nigo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigo)), 'cos
most of the jams won't sound out of place during an extended exfoliation
session. but you should enjoy the soothing vibes wherever you're at. Find
experimental techno diversions, Houston hip-hop, ethereal footwork waves, bleepy
dancehall and more sweet infusions inside.

This is something of a break from the usual content I have posted here. In 2017,
I started this blog to write about and share examples of my work in data
science/data sci-adjacent areas. The work of [Yihui](https://yihui.name/) in
creating [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) made it fun to share
technical posts and give back to the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) community,
something I did with regularity last year.

This year, I have consciously put less pressure on myself to force through ideas
(noticeable from the date of my last post), and I've dedicated more time on
other crafts and passions, following creative thoughts naturally. I want to use
this site to document all my creations, whatever the medium (and likely
audience) and without hang-ups about the Personal Brand^TM^. So, tune in and
tune out when it feels good âœ¨
