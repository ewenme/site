Some of the records I have really appreciated in "H1" 2019 are here. There's a
[Buy Music Club](https://buymusic.club/) list at the bottom to go buy the ones
you like and support the artists behind them, too!

**Logic1000, LOGIC1000** _[SUMAC]_ - Punchy and vibrant Aussie twists on UK
funky rhythms, also featuring a slammin'
[Niche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwO16Eg5NOc) rework.

**Shy One & Kwam, Spoons** _[Astral Black]_ - An ode to life, London and
Wetherspoons, recorded in ONE DAY. Raw, relatable lyrics and cold productions.

**Budgie, Holy Ghost Zone** _[Self-released]_ - More effortless Gospel bounce
according to Budgie. That's 685 – 689 Old Kent Road on the cover!

**Powder, Powder In Space** _[Beats in Space]_ - Powder goes into space and
brings back only the freshest house, for your enjoyment.

**Sikka Rymes, Love Di People** _[DUPPY GUN]_ - Completely wild and essential
performance from Sikka, perfectly complemented by bonkers Genesis Hull beats.

**Solange, When I Get Home** _[Columbia]_ - Playful, spiritual jazz and Houston
sounds form a stunning patchwork to get fully lost in.

**Dave, Psychodrama** _[Neighbourhood]_ - Powerful and difficult listening at
times, but allways important and gravitational raps from Streatham's finest.

**Anz, Invitation 2 Dance** _[2 B Real]_ - The first of two heavy hitters from
Manchester on here. "Play these ones loud."

**Belter, Off The Meds** _[Studio Barnhus]_ - Hypnotic and intoxicating full
debut from the Swedish-South African crew, does what it says on the tin. Joy
kicks on from [81b](https://tossportal.bandcamp.com/album/81b) with party-mode
remix business.

**Bézier, 府城** _[Honey Soundsystem]_ - Tracks you can't label, the result of a
deeply moving and emotional recording process.

**India Jordan, DNT STP MY LV** _[LOCAL ACTION]_ - More Manc royalty! Title
track is the percy, will turn any frown upside down + activate hips without
warning.

**Various, PDA Compilation Volume 1** _[PDA]_ - 100% club heat from PDA
friends + fam. All profits go to the Association of Queer Ethnic Minorities
(A.Q.E.M), too.

**Afrikan Sciences, & The Kick Drum is Default** _[Deepblak]_ - Eric rewiring
your little brain, as ever.

**Tujiko Noriko, Kuro (OST)** _[ENTOPIA]_ - Tense, atmospheric soundscapes on
_PANs_ new soundtrack offshoot.

**Gila, Trench Tones** _[Lex Records]_ - Runs through hip-hop, techno and
ambient wonder. Had to cop the wax for that [Eric Hu](www.erichu.info) artwork!

**Tierra Whack, All the singles** _[Self-released]_ - The Dr Seuss type spitter
paints fully-formed tracks this year with as much colour as 2018's _Whack World_
vignettes. I stan.
