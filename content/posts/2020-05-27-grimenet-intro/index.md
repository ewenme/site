Last week, I put out a site â€” [GRIMENET](https://apps.ewen.io/grimenet/). There,
it's possible for fans of UK Grime to explore how the scene works as a social
network through collaborations on records. Hit the **?** icon in the app for a
bit of background on the work and why I wanted to put this together. In short, I
wanted to try and use data viz as a medium for expressing the collaborative
nature of an MC-led, localised music scene.

If this interests you, go fill ur boots. The
[code](https://github.com/ewenme/grimenet) +
[data](https://github.com/ewenme/grime-archives) used is open-sourced, too, if
you wanna go under the hood or create something yourself.
