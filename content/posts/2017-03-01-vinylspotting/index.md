At a glance, it's hard to learn much about a vinyl record collection beyond it's
size (or perhaps age, depending on the smell?). If you get up close, you might
recognise names on the spines of some LPs, but some collectors are gonna have
bits that even _they_ don't recognise on sight. Now, while the unadulterated
excitement of finding a [white label](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_label)
on the shelve that even _you_ can't remember might fuel the romance at the heart
of record digging, just the thought of such forgotten artifacts would make
archivists and librarians nervous.

Enter [Discogs](http://www.discogs.com) - the definitive recorded music database
and marketplace, with over 8 million record entries and counting. Aside from
tumbling through all sorts of audio rabbit-holes, Discogs users can forensically
catalog their own collection. Once you've reached a few hundred records, having
a well-kept digital archive of your music to refer to is sometimes the only way
of answering _"did I already buy that record?"_, without having to leaf through
the physical lot.

A user can browse through the individual entries for each of their records, see
an overview of their whole collection:

It's essentially a tabulated view of your records with rudimentary info, and
some record sleeve thumbnails to boot. The 'collection value' is a new addition
that, as far as I can tell, is the **only** summary statistic on show (besides
the count), which got me thinking:

> If I've amassed hundreds (or thousand) of records, and carefully keyed each
> into a digital database, it would be cool to learn a bit more about my
> collection beyond it's monetary worth.

My next thought was, "[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) could probably help
with that".

## Unpacking "it would be cool to learn a bit more"

How could you explore someones record collection metadata, visually, in a useful
and coherent way?

A few concepts were prominent in my head-space:

- Part of **what makes a record collection unique and special is how it evolves
  over time**: it's not static and intakes distinct phases. I had to find a way
  to make this temporal element a central thread.
- Aside from insight about what's _in_ their collection, something else that
  could be interpreted from the metadata records was **a snapshot of user's
  buying patterns.**
- The somewhat on-rails experience of a Shiny app seemed like a suitable
  environment to aid record collectors' discovery, essentially **a natural,
  digital extension of the digging process.**
- The app should mirror the treasured and personal state of the subject matter.
  In keeping, the **language adopted should be idiosyncratic and approachable.**

## Introducing vinylSpotting

_vinylSpotting_ is now available for diggers everywhere over
[here](https://apps.ewen.io/vinylspotting), with a tiny showcase below.

Head over to the app itself to play, then check the
[github repo](https://github.com/ewenme/vinylspotting) if you want to see the
Shiny code. Behind the scenes, _vinylSpotting_ retrieves public Discogs
collections via the [Discogs API v2.0](https://www.discogs.com/developers/)
(sidenote - the data heavy lifting is made simple courtesy of the
[discogger](https://github.com/ewenme/discogger) package, in case you want to
use the Discogs API in your own project).

## To do's / limitations

The most glaring omission here is any kind of spend analytics - unfortunately,
Discogs don't offer up their marketplace sales data in the public API offering
(though there has been previous for publications to get exclusive access (hint,
hint)) so for now, it's off limits. Something that I chose to exclude was
record's rating data (i.e. what the average rating for a record was), which felt
like it could be noise in an app that would explore a single user's collection
and, thus, would mostly contain records that person already rated highly (i.e.
they bought it).

Also, the current measure of buying patterns, assuming that a record was bought
at the time it was added to the site, is only as accurate as the users
timeliness in pushing their new records to the site when they buy them. It may
be that for some users who sit on a backlog of records and upload them to the
site all at once, such proxies become skewed.

With time, an interesting exercise could be to fit a time series model to user's
collections to provide a forecast of the size of their collection in the future.
The recently open-sourced
[Prophet](https://facebookincubator.github.io/prophet/) could be a suitably
flexible procedure to implement in a Shiny app environment.
