The latest edition of bathing tapes is out there, recorded at home on a Sunday a
couple of months ago. The mix is mostly stuff that came out in the second half
of this year that I've been bumping. There's frenetic techno and grime
combinations, deviant pop and electro runs, and euphoric breakbeats rubbing
against lonely bassweight jams. As always, credit and love to the makers of all
this music, filled me up all autumn and beyond.
