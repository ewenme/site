For my sins, I am a Newcastle United fan. Watching them play has been hard graft for a decent while.

```{r nufc-xg, out.width="100%"}
# plot of rolling xG for newcastle
```

Why bother? Even in the darkest days of Sports Direct FC, there have been glimmers of joy to grab with both hands. Once upon a time, Alan Pardew might have treated us with a Hatem Ben Arfa cameo. Today, we are pacified by the one-man dribbling band that is Allan Saint-Maximin.

```{r dribble-carries, out.width="100%"}
# plot of dribbles x carries
```
