There's a fun show on N\*tflix called Russian Doll where Nadia (played by
Natasha Lyonne, good egg) keeps dying in-and-around her 36th bday party for the
whole first season. It's the time loop drama premise with death but it has an
idiosyncratic energy led by Lyonne (Nadia's first theory for the time loop is
that it's a k-hole). There is a stylistic confidence going on that makes it's
version of NYC feel lived in and cosy. As the series progresses, the whimsiness
reveals itself to be a defence mechanism that gives way to sincere melancholy
and introspection. The time loop is effectively deployed as a metaphor for
reliving, and healing from, trauma. It's notes are hit smoothly all the way down
(PS I haven't seen the second series yet but I hear it's even better).

I clocked Deathloop over the weekend. As the name suggests, you seem to die and
wake up on the same day. You decide to go find clues to piece together the
mystery and determine how to kill all of the baddies in a single day and "break
the loop". When you find a significant clue, an animated cut-scene interjects
and stylistically summarises the plot, while the "leads" menu neatly charts out
your discoveries. The gameplay is similarly suave and empowering - you quickly
learn that the "map" is quite diddy and requires you to retread your steps (a
lot). What this means is that you inevitably learn the layout of each area and
the patterns of enemies within.

In vibe and looks it almost felt like a Russian Doll tie-in game. You play as
Colt, who cracks jokes to himself and cusses out the only other character he
really has dialogue with, Juliana. The in-game aesthetic is like a 1960s action
film set world-building exercise.
