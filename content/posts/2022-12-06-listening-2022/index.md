Whomst do I think I am with these EOY lists? Anyway here is a collection of
things I listened to and loved in the big year of 2k22. Have a butchers, there
might be something in here that you would enjoy playing at unsociable volumes
whilst driving in your motor, or use to bond with a mate that sincerely
describes themselves as being "into music", or at worst offer a lifeline in a
pass-the-aux situation where ur other selections are bringing the vibe down.

## DJ Python — Angel

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3583986897/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/track=1159184396/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://djpythonnyc.bandcamp.com/album/club-sentimientos-vol-2">Club Sentimientos Vol 2 by DJ Python</a></iframe>

DJ Python makes music you can dance to, cry to, have a bubblebath for a little
too long to. The first time I heard _Angel_, my mind transported me back to a
track from his first album (_Dulce Compañia_) called _Todo Era Azul (Versio n
Afuera)_. Both pieces gently hold your hand and offer up sincere beauty. I love
artists whose work slowly reveals a congruent world that you feel yourself
revisiting and reinterpreting with every new work. I love these "liner notes"
from the release page!

## Knucks — ALPHA PLACE

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zf6xRTiOz8I?controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In _Three Musketeers_, Knucks closes out the album in storytelling mode with a
vibrant and moving tribute to longtime best mates L’s and T.P. It's a heartfelt
collage of memories and dreams, blessed music. It's a full-length movie rapped
out in about two-and-a-half minutes, followed by two snippets of audio. The
first sounds like a recent catch-up between the trio, where the men embody
gratitude and love for each other:

> like this shit is a blessin', bro...The fact that all three of us are
> here...And that dream's still possible

The second is a back-in-the-day blast of young Knuckles on the mic:

> Cause you get chewed like Trident Gum

This ain't just a complex love letter to Alpha House, Alpha Place in North West
London. It's a considerate and intentional intertwining of drill sensibilities
with jazz flourishes. Venna, who EP'd the album, is a long-time collaborator and
friend, and it shows. From the moment he lands on sax duties for the album
opener, _Alpha House_, there's intimacy and chemistry between the musicianship
and what Knucks is saying as he floats over it. In feeling and execution, I'm
reminded of _Mala in Cuba_ or Swindle's _The New World_ (which, incidentally,
has a Knucks feature). The artistry is on a different level here and I just
found out that he got to share MOBO album of the year w Little Simz so the
flowers are rightfully flowing <3

## Nate Scheible — Fairfax

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3811368490/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/track=2038031905/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://natescheible.bandcamp.com/album/fairfax">Fairfax by Nate Scheible</a></iframe>

Of everything I've rounded up here, listening to this record is the most
emotionally exhausting and haunting of all. Not one I've got on heavy rotation
or anything. It builds around a series of tape recordings that capture someone
describing longing, despair and finally hope in a form so raw an alien would get
it. I imagine that this is as close I'll get to being a catholic priest
listening to someone's most private confession.

## Angel D'lite — 303 Dalmatians

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3742062562/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://planeteuphorique.bandcamp.com/album/303-dalmatians">303 Dalmatians by Angel D&#39;Lite</a></iframe>

A Kode 9 RA Exchange episode this year has stuck with me. In particular, he
explains how club music doesn't change over time in a linear fashion but that
it's recursive and mutates (iirc). Whenever I feel a bit disillusioned with
familiar tropes or genres coming back around, an artist like Angel D'lite
appears and gives me the jolt I need to avoid straying into "old man yells at
cloud" territory. Just like her _Re4mat_ EP, also from this year, _303
Dalmatians_ is sugary-sweet pop rave bliss with a sour kick for good measure.

## Vegyn — Don't Follow Me Because I'm Lost Too!!

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3767420141/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/track=569564039/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://vegyn.bandcamp.com/album/dont-follow-me-because-im-lost-too">Don&#39;t Follow Me Because I&#39;m Lost Too!! by Vegyn</a></iframe>

I wasn't rly hip to Vegyn until quite recently but I knew I had to get busy in
the back catalogue when I found myself chomping through this 75(!) track beat
tape in one sitting. The last time I remember having this sort of experience was
with
[Arca's KICK series](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/arca-kick-ii-kick-iii-kick-iiii-kick-iiiii/),
or
[Dean Blunt's Roaches](https://www.discogs.com/release/23016347-Dean-Blunt-Roach-2012-2019).
_Don't Follow Me..._ takes you down the rabbit hole, every door you peek in
teases a different sonic landscape. Find a spare hour and get the incense going.

## Kali Malone — Living Torch

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3191162786/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://kalimalone.bandcamp.com/album/living-torch">Living Torch by Kali Malone</a></iframe>

I'm not well read in music theory and don't play an instrument so I can't tell
you if this record is technically impressive or what not. It's fucking intense
and affirming to listen to it, though, and that's enough for me. It's a
soundscape that goes on for bleedin' miles, requires you to listen deeply and
patiently. I actually enjoy not knowing things, sometimes, so that stuff like
this remains baffling and mystical.

## HiTech — HiTech

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1749468840/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/track=3635037957/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://omar-s.bandcamp.com/album/hitech">HiTech by Feat, Stephan xix, Nila and King Milo produced by King Milo</a></iframe>

Debut full-length of the cutest and catchiest ghetto tech bops from Detroit duo
Milf Melly and King Milo AKA HiTech, rubber-stamped by none other than Omar S.
Throw it on any time of the day you need a bit more pep and these two will have
you on job in no time.

## Novelist — 4 Tha Homiez

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hu4OdBn4Yoo?controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

A new Nov record is "like a box of chocolates", in the best way. On _4 Tha
Homies_ we got a sun-drenched, South London reinterpretation of West Coast G
Funk alongside things that go like R&B&drill just in time for summer. I had
_Quantum Leap_ in my 2020 round-up, a devastating set of avant garde
instrumentals. I really like getting to listen in on his journey and am always
inspired by the fearlessness on full display every single time.

## Influenza Prods. — Mémoire

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2002711063/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/track=3726197827/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://influenzaprods.bandcamp.com/album/me-moire">Mémoire by Influenza Prods.</a></iframe>

Sometimes you know a record is going to be hard from just it's backstory. In
this case, Bruno De Angelis and Giovanna Gulinello got together after one was
rescued from a shit date by the other, moved back to Rome from London and
starting recording bits and pieces (including dialogue from English soaps on
their TV set and their family's cutlery sets) on to homemade tapes. Fittingly,
this collection is titled _Mémoire_, a snapshot of a point-in-time these two
people found each other and honored this through intimate art that we get to
treasure now.

## Death Is Not The End — Pure Wicked Tune: Rare Groove Blues Dances & House Parties, 1985-1992

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3030830616/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/track=162905885/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://deathisnot.bandcamp.com/album/pure-wicked-tune-rare-groove-blues-dances-house-parties-1985-1992">Pure Wicked Tune: Rare Groove Blues Dances &amp; House Parties, 1985-1992 by Death Is Not The End</a></iframe>

This label have been putting out the maddest, deepest treasure trove
compilations of all sorts of goodness. I could've easily picked out either of
the _Pause for the Cause: London Rave Adverts_ volumes, but for pure static
warmth and feeling it's gotta be _Pure Wicked Tune_. It draws you in to the room
the same way the best podcasts do, except the room is the most bless house party
in South London circa 1990. Somebody pls pass your man a flashlight...

## Moin — Paste

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2622564160/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/track=1951177551/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://m-o-i-n.bandcamp.com/album/paste-2">Paste by Moin</a></iframe>

_Paste_ is a heady trip through muddy guitar riffs and ruff electronics, full of
heart and punchy vocals. It's really got me back in to guitar music and wanting
to go see some noisy bands as soon as possible. There's so many quirky,
unexpected turns in the record - _Forgetting is Like Syrup_ sounds like a folk
reinterpretation of Memphis rap, _In a Tizzy_ bumps up intimate field recordings
with yelping samples and tender guitar licks.

## Frisco — Tottenham EP

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EbaCB4Kr4sk?controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Scratcha (DVA) playing _Bad & Clean_ at Lente Kabinet festival was one of my
dance floor highlights from the summer. Every INFAMOUSIZAK stutter begs the
reload. _Albany Close_ is another track from this EP that has stayed in my cups
to this day. Love to see Frisco about and firing on all cylinders.

## rRoxymore — Perpetual Now

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 42px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2482570296/size=small/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/track=2402142078/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://rroxymore.bandcamp.com/album/perpetual-now">Perpetual Now by rRoxymore</a></iframe>

Probably the only record on here I'd (broadly) label as techno, but that doesn't
tell half the story. Each track is a heads-down, wigged-out excursion into the
deepest techno depths. The tracks are noticeably long but they earn it. Just as
comfortable on an open-minded dancefloor as it is at the afters, or past
midnight coming down the M25. Chill but hard at the same time somehow?!

## KAKUHAN — Metal Zone

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PGS7HBjz9Cw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I'll leave this one to the Hardwax dons:

> Superb, traditional/futuristic Eastern/Western, sparse Grime to Ambient to Neo
> Classical inspired Electronica explorer - one per customer only
